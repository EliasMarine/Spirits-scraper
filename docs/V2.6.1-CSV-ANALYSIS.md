# V2.6.1 CSV Analysis - Critical Issues Found

## Analysis Date: 2025-06-14
**CSV File**: spirits_rows (32).csv  
**Total Entries**: 115

## 🎯 Summary
After V2.6.1 emergency fix, the smart validator is now **too lenient**, allowing non-products through while correctly populating the proof column.

## ✅ What's Working
1. **Proof Column**: Successfully populated for all spirits with ABV (proof = ABV × 2)
2. **Price Data**: Reasonable values where populated
3. **ABV Values**: Correctly extracted and stored

## ❌ Critical Issues

### 1. Non-Product Names Getting Through
These should have been rejected but weren't:
```
- "Bbc Bourbon Barrel Loft Event Space In Louisville Ky The Vendry" (event venue)
- "Bardstown Bourbon Co Bottling Joseph & Joseph Architects" (architecture firm)
- "Bourbon Experience Belle Meade Winery Nashville's Oldest Winery" (tour)
- "Colonel De New Riff Barrel Smoked Spices" (food product)
- "Bourbon Honey Gold Rush" (cocktail recipe)
- "Bourbon The Well Known Bourbons With Sweeter Notes" (article/category page)
```

### 2. Poor Brand Quality
- **Lowercase brands**: "bardstown", "high west", "four roses"
- **Invalid brands**: "unknown", "colonel de", "fusion series", "core", "bundles", "drink belle"
- **Truncated brands**: "high" instead of "High West"
- **Missing brands**: Many entries have null/empty brand

### 3. Limited Type Detection
- **Distribution**: 106 Bourbon, 9 Rye Whiskey, 0 others
- **Missing types**: No Single Malt, Tennessee Whiskey, Scotch, etc.
- **Under-detection**: High West products should be Rye but showing as Bourbon

### 4. Description Issues
- Truncated with "..." 
- Duplicate content
- Store information mixed in
- Some are just fragments

### 5. Data Quality Scores
- **Low (35-60)**: 45% of entries
- **Medium (61-80)**: 35% of entries
- **High (81-100)**: 20% of entries

Average score ~60, indicating systematic quality issues.
