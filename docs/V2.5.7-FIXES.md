# V2.5.7 Fixes - Next Phase Improvements

## Document Purpose
This document tracks planned and implemented fixes for V2.5.7, building upon the successful V2.5.6 data quality improvements.

## Context from V2.5.6
V2.5.6 successfully addressed critical data quality issues:
- ‚úÖ Non-product content rejection (websites, articles)
- ‚úÖ Truncated name detection and cleaning
- ‚úÖ Store artifact removal (Bottega Whiskey, Crown Wine, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Price validation and auto-adjustment ($10-$5000 range)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced product name validation
- ‚úÖ Improved catalog scraping with intelligent distillery selection

## Critical Issues Found in Latest CSV (2025-06-13)

### üö® IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

#### 1. **Proof Column Not Being Populated**
- **Issue**: The `proof` column is completely empty/null despite ABV being populated
- **Impact**: Missing critical spirit data that users expect
- **Examples**: All 69 entries have null proof values
- **Root Cause**: Proof calculation not implemented in storage logic

#### 2. **Poor Quality Product Names Still Getting Through**
- **Issue**: Non-descriptive names and fragments
- **Examples**:
  - ". Bourbon. Result" (meaningless)
  - "Bourbon Biscuits" (food product, not spirit)
  - "53 G Heaven Hill Distillery..." (starts with weight)
  - "Ba Lcones Whiskey" (broken brand name)
- **Root Cause**: Validation still not catching all edge cases

#### 3. **Inconsistent Brand Extraction**
- **Issue**: Brand column mostly empty, brand names fragmented
- **Examples**:
  - "Ba Lcones" instead of "Balcones"
  - "53 g" as brand
  - "Bourbon-glazed pork" as brand
- **Root Cause**: Brand extraction logic needs improvement

#### 4. **Non-Spirit Items Still Being Stored**
- **Issue**: Food items and non-beverage products
- **Examples**:
  - "Bourbon Biscuits"
  - "Bourbon-glazed Pork Belly Chunks"
  - "Bourbon Barrel Aged Coffee"
- **Root Cause**: Product validation too lenient

#### 5. **Poor Type Classification**
- **Issue**: Many products marked as "Other" when they should be specific types
- **Examples**:
  - Balcones Single Malt marked as "Other" instead of "Single Malt"
  - All non-bourbon whiskeys defaulting to "Other"

## V2.5.7 Focus Areas

### 1. üîß Fix Proof Column Population (CRITICAL)
**Current Issue**:
- Proof column completely empty in database despite ABV being captured
- Users expect proof values for American whiskeys

**Immediate Fix Required**:
- [x] Calculate proof from ABV: `proof = ABV * 2`
- [ ] Update storage logic to save proof value
- [ ] Backfill existing spirits with calculated proof
- [ ] Add validation: proof should be between 40-150 for most spirits

### 2. üéØ Enhanced Price Intelligence
**Current Issues**:
- Currency conversion not implemented for non-USD prices
- Some prices still missing extraction patterns
- Need better handling of sale/MSRP price differences

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Implement currency detection and conversion
- [ ] Add more price extraction patterns (‚Ç¨, ¬£, ¬•, etc.)
- [ ] Handle "was/now" pricing (sale prices)
- [ ] Extract prices from multiple sources and average
- [ ] Implement price history tracking

### 2. üîç Advanced Product Verification
**Current Issues**:
- Some edge cases still slip through validation
- No image verification for products
- Limited ability to verify product authenticity

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Implement image analysis for product verification
- [ ] Cross-reference with known product databases
- [ ] Add ML-based product classification
- [ ] Verify products against distillery official catalogs
- [ ] Flag suspicious or potentially counterfeit products

### 3. üìä Data Enrichment
**Current Issues**:
- Missing tasting notes and flavor profiles
- Limited award/rating information
- No production details (limited editions, batch info)

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Extract tasting notes from descriptions
- [ ] Capture award information (Gold Medal, 95 points, etc.)
- [ ] Extract production quantities for limited editions
- [ ] Add seasonal/special release detection
- [ ] Implement flavor profile categorization

### 4. üöÄ Performance Optimization
**Current Issues**:
- API efficiency could be improved beyond 6.3 spirits/call
- Cache could be smarter about predicting needs
- Duplicate checking could be faster

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Implement predictive caching based on scraping patterns
- [ ] Optimize database queries with better indexes
- [ ] Add parallel processing for non-API operations
- [ ] Implement bloom filters for faster duplicate detection
- [ ] Add result pre-filtering to reduce processing

### 5. üõ°Ô∏è Data Quality Monitoring
**Current Issues**:
- No automated quality alerts
- Manual review needed for anomalies
- No tracking of quality trends over time

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Implement automated quality scoring alerts
- [ ] Add anomaly detection for unusual data patterns
- [ ] Create quality dashboard with trends
- [ ] Set up automated cleanup jobs
- [ ] Add data quality webhooks for monitoring

### 6. üåê Expanded Source Coverage
**Current Issues**:
- Limited to 152 trusted domains
- Missing some regional retailers
- No auction house integration

**Planned Fixes**:
- [ ] Add more trusted international retailers
- [ ] Integrate auction house APIs (Christie's, Sotheby's)
- [ ] Add specialty whisky investment platforms
- [ ] Implement dynamic domain trust scoring
- [ ] Add region-specific search optimizations

## V2.5.7 Implementation Results

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Proof Column Population** 
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solution**: Added proof calculation in `storeSpirit()` method
- **Code**: `proof: parsedData.abv ? Math.round(parsedData.abv * 2) : null`
- **Result**: All spirits with ABV will now have proof values

#### 2. **Enhanced Product Name Validation**
- **Status**: üü° PARTIALLY FIXED (needs testing)
- **Solutions Added**:
  - Reject single word products (". Bourbon.")
  - Reject food patterns (biscuit, cake, coffee, sauce, etc.)
  - Reject broken/fragmented names (less than 10 chars)
  - Require proper brand indicators
  - Clean and validate brand names

#### 3. **Improved Brand Extraction**
- **Status**: üü° PARTIALLY FIXED (needs testing)

  - Remove weight prefixes ("53 G")
  - Extract brand from product name if missing
  - Validate against known brand list

#### 4. **Better Type Classification**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solutions Added**:

  - Added Balcones to brandToType mapping for "American Single Malt"
  - Enhanced pattern matching for single malt products
  - Fixed priority ordering to check Single Malt before generic whiskey types
