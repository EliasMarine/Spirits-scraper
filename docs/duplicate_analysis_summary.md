### 3. Data Quality Issues

1. **Inconsistent Type Classification**
   - Same products classified differently (e.g., Bourbon vs Whiskey)
   - Generic "Whiskey" used when specific type (Bourbon) would be more accurate

2. **Marketing Text in Product Names**
   - Retailer-specific text included in names
   - Website/review platform references

3. **Size Variants as Separate Products**
   - Different bottle sizes listed as distinct products
   - No volume field to differentiate properly

4. **Abbreviation Inconsistencies**
   - "Pf" vs "Proof"
   - Incomplete product names

### 4. Recommendations for Deduplication

1. **Normalize Product Names**
   - Remove marketing/retail text
   - Standardize proof notation
   - Strip size indicators

2. **Improve Type Classification**
   - Use consistent, specific types (Bourbon instead of generic Whiskey)
   - Validate type against known brand/product mappings

3. **Add Metadata Fields**
   - Volume/size as separate field
   - Release year as separate field
   - Special edition indicators

4. **Implement Fuzzy Matching**
   - Account for minor spelling variations
   - Consider brand-specific naming patterns
