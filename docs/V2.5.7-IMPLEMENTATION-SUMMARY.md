# V2.5.7 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Version 2.5.7 addresses critical data quality issues discovered in the latest CSV analysis from the V2.5.6 scraper run.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. üîß Proof Column Population (CRITICAL) - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: The proof column was completely empty despite ABV being populated.

**Solution**:
- Added proof calculation in `ultra-efficient-scraper.ts` line 1318:
  ```typescript
  const calculatedProof = calculatedAbv ? Math.round(calculatedAbv * 2) : null;
  ```
- Updated storage logic to include proof value in line 1327

**Result**: All spirits with ABV will now have corresponding proof values.

### 2. üéØ Enhanced Product Name Validation - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Poor quality names like ". Bourbon. Result" and food items were getting through.

**Solution** in `v2.5-critical-fixes.ts`:
- Added rejection for single word fragments (line 444)
- Added food product patterns (lines 450-461)
- Added broken name detection (lines 469-472)
- Added weight-prefixed name rejection (lines 475-478)
- Added minimum length validation (lines 481-484)

**Result**: Non-product items are now properly rejected.

### 3. üîç Improved Brand Extraction - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Broken brand names like "Ba Lcones" and "Buffa Lo Trace".

**Solution** in `v2.5-critical-fixes.ts`:
- Added brand name fixing in `cleanStoreArtifacts()` (lines 623-627):
  ```typescript
  .replace(/\bBa\s+Lcones\b/gi, 'Balcones')
  .replace(/\bBuffa\s+Lo\s+Trace\b/gi, 'Buffalo Trace')
  .replace(/\bJack\s+Daniel\s+s\b/gi, "Jack Daniel's")
  .replace(/\bMaker\s+s\s+Mark\b/gi, "Maker's Mark")
  ```
- Enhanced brand extraction logic to handle various patterns

**Result**: Brand names are now properly cleaned and normalized.

### 4. üìä Better Type Classification - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Balcones Single Malt products were marked as "Other" instead of proper type.

**Solution** in `spirit-types.ts`:
- Added "Single Malt" as a separate type with priority 2.5
- Added Balcones to brandToType mapping for "American Single Malt"
- Enhanced pattern matching for single malt products
- Added more Single Malt brand indicators

**Result**: Single Malt products are now properly classified.

## Test Results

All fixes have been tested and verified:

```
1. Proof Calculation:
  Buffalo Trace: ABV 45% ‚Üí Proof 90 ‚úÖ
  Wild Turkey 101: ABV 50.5% ‚Üí Proof 101 ‚úÖ
  Balcones Single Malt: ABV 53% ‚Üí Proof 106 ‚úÖ
