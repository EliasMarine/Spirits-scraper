# Metadata, Image URL, and Quality Score Fixes

## Issues Identified in CSV Data

After analyzing `spirits_rows (22).csv`, three critical issues were found:

### 1. ❌ Empty Metadata Objects
- **Problem**: All entries had `metadata: {}` instead of structured metadata
- **Root Cause**: `prepareForDatabase()` was overriding scraped_data with minimal fixed structure
- **Impact**: Lost valuable extraction metadata, source information, and context

### 2. ❌ Missing Image URLs  
- **Problem**: Many spirits had empty `image_url` fields
- **Root Cause**: Image extraction not prioritized, fallback mechanisms inadequate
- **Impact**: Poor visual presentation in frontend applications

### 3. ❌ Incorrect Quality Scores
- **Problem**: All spirits had default scores (20, 30, 40, 50) instead of calculated values
- **Root Cause**: Quality calculation algorithm was too simplistic
- **Impact**: Inability to filter or prioritize high-quality data

### 4. ❌ Price Extraction Issues
- **Problem**: Years, ages, proof values, and batch numbers extracted as prices
- **Examples**: 
  - "1993 Buffalo Trace" → price: 1993
  - "Wild Turkey 8 Year Old" → price: 8  
  - "Buffalo Trace 101 Proof" → price: 101
  - "125-experimental Collection" → price: 125

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Metadata Population

**File**: `src/services/spirit-extractor.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: No metadata population
// AFTER: Comprehensive metadata structure
extractedData.scraped_data = {
  source: "google_search_api",
  version: "1.0", 
  scraped_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  extraction_method: "spirit_extractor",
  queries_used: queries.length,
  results_processed: allResults.length,
  parsing_results: parsedResults.length,
  page_metadata: firstResult.metadata,
  image_source: extractedData.image_url,
  image_extraction_method: "search_results"
};
```

**File**: `src/services/supabase-storage.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fixed minimal structure
scraped_data: {
  scraped_at: spirit.scraped_at,
  source: 'google_search_api', 
  version: '1.0',
}

// AFTER: Use provided metadata or fallback
scraped_data: spirit.scraped_data || {
  scraped_at: spirit.scraped_at,
  source: 'google_search_api',
  version: '1.0',
}
```

### 2. ✅ Improved Image URL Extraction

**Enhanced Strategy**:
- Google Image Search fallback for missing images
- Better validation of image URLs (exclude placeholders, 1x1 pixels)
- Priority scoring for high-quality image sources
- Source tracking in metadata

### 3. ✅ Fixed Price Extraction

**File**: `src/services/content-parser.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: Extracted any number as price
// AFTER: Strict validation with blacklist

const invalidValues = [
  // Years: 1990-2025
  1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999,
  2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009,
  2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019,
  2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025,
  // Common ages: 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 30
  // Common proof values: 80-115
  // Bottle sizes: 375, 500, 700, 750, 1000, 1750
  // Batch numbers: 125-130
];

// Skip text containing years, ages, proof without price context
if (/\b(19\d{2}|20\d{2})\b/.test(cleanText)) {
  if (!/(\$|price|cost|usd|eur|gbp)/i.test(cleanText)) {
    return null; // Year without price context
  }
}
```

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Quality Score Calculation

**File**: `src/services/spirit-extractor.ts`
```typescript
// NEW: Comprehensive quality algorithm
private calculateSimpleQualityScore(data: Partial<SpiritData>): number {
  let score = 0;
  let maxScore = 0;

  // Core fields (20 points each): name, type, brand, description
  // Important fields (10 points each): abv, proof, price, age_statement, image_url, source_url
  // Quality bonuses (20 points): description quality, image validity, source validity
  
  // Bonuses for high-quality descriptions (length > 100, contains production terms)
  // Bonuses for specific types (not generic "Whiskey" or "Other")
  // Range: 30-95 points
}
```

## Fix Script Created

**File**: `fix-metadata-images-quality.ts`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Fix specific issues (recommended first)
npm run fix-specific

# Fix all issues including metadata and images  
npm run fix-metadata
```

**Features**:
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- Progress tracking and detailed logging
- Handles API limits gracefully  
- Validates all fixes before applying
- Comprehensive error handling

## Expected Results After Fixes

### Metadata
- ✅ Rich structured metadata with extraction details
- ✅ Source information and query tracking
- ✅ Image source attribution
- ✅ Processing statistics

### Image URLs
- ✅ 80%+ spirits with valid image URLs
- ✅ High-quality images from trusted sources
- ✅ No placeholder or broken image links

### Quality Scores  
- ✅ Calculated scores based on data completeness
- ✅ Range of 30-95 instead of fixed values
- ✅ Bonus points for quality indicators
- ✅ Proper filtering capabilities

### Prices
- ✅ No years extracted as prices (1991, 1993, etc.)
- ✅ No ages extracted as prices (8, 12, 15, etc.)
- ✅ No proof values extracted as prices (101, 102, etc.)
- ✅ Only valid currency amounts ($5-$5000 range)

## Future Prevention

These fixes ensure that future scrapes will:
1. Always populate metadata with extraction context
2. Attempt image extraction with fallbacks
3. Calculate proper quality scores
4. Validate prices against known invalid patterns

The underlying scraper services have been updated to prevent these issues from recurring.
