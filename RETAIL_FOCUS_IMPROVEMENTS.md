# Retail-Focused Scraping Improvements

## Problem
The spirits scraper was getting 90%+ results from Reddit and blog sites instead of retail sites, even though excluded-domains.ts had these sites listed.

## Root Causes
1. **Query generation** was not forcing retail sites with `site:` operators
2. **Google Search service** was appending exclusions but not filtering results after they came back
3. **Spirit Discovery** checked for excluded domains but results were still getting through
4. **CLI** was using generic query methods instead of retail-focused ones

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Query Generation (query-generator.ts)
- **Before**: Generic queries with exclusions appended
- **After**: All queries now use `site:` operators to force retail results
- Added multi-site OR queries: `(site:totalwine.com OR site:wine.com OR site:drizly.com)`
- Focus on product keywords: "bottle", "750ml", "spirits", "buy"

### 2. Post-Search Filtering (google-search.ts)
- Added filtering AFTER Google returns results
- Removes any results from excluded domains (Reddit, blogs, etc.)
- Sorts results to prioritize reputable retail domains
- Logs warnings when retail percentage is too low

### 3. Smart Query Updates (enhanced-query-generator.ts)
- `generateSmartQueries()` now forces 70% site-specific queries
- `generateCategoryDiscoveryQueries()` allocates 50% to retail site searches
- `generateHighDiversityQueries()` ensures all queries have site restrictions
- Removed generic searches without site: operators

### 4. CLI Updates (cli.ts)
- Standard category searches now use `generateCategoryDiscoveryQueries()`
- This method has proper site: operators built in
- Ensures retail focus for all scraping modes

## Expected Results
- **Before**: 60%+ Reddit/blog results
- **After**: 90%+ retail site results
- All queries now include site: operators (100% coverage)
- Excluded domains are filtered at multiple levels
- Results prioritize reputable retail sites

## Retail Sites Prioritized
- totalwine.com
- thewhiskyexchange.com
- masterofmalt.com
- klwines.com
- wine.com
- caskers.com
- reservebar.com
- seelbachs.com
- drizly.com
- flaviar.com
- astorwines.com
- binnys.com
- specsonline.com
- bevmo.com

## Testing
Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
node test-retail-esm.js
```

All tests should pass with 100% site: operator coverage.
