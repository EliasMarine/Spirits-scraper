# Duplicate Analysis Report for spirits_rows (14).csv

## Executive Summary

- **Total Spirits Analyzed**: 32
- **Exact Name Duplicates**: 0 (0%)
- **Estimated True Duplicates**: 8-10 spirits (25-31% duplicate rate)
- **Current Fuzzy Matching Performance**: Catching some but not all duplicates

## Key Findings

### 1. No Exact Name Duplicates
The dataset contains no spirits with identical names, which means all potential duplicates have name variations.

### 2. Significant Brand Groupings with Variations

#### Buffalo Trace (4 entries, likely 2-3 unique products)
- Buffalo Trace Bourbon - $129.99
- Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon - $119.99
- Buffalo Trace Bourbon Private Select'barrel 684' - $74.995 (unique: private barrel selection)
- Buffalo Trace's Single Estate Farm Continues Expansion - $19 (questionable entry, seems like article title)

#### Woodford Reserve (5 entries, likely 3-4 unique products)
- Woodford Reserve Bourbon - $69.495
- Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon - $69.495 (same product, same price)
- Woodford Reserve Batch Proof - $114.995 (unique: batch proof variant)
- Woodford Reserve Double Oak Store Pick 1 - $40.99 (unique: double oak variant)
- Straight Bourbon Whiskey-woodford Reserve - $136.995 (likely duplicate with parsing issue)

#### Four Roses (3 entries, likely 2 unique products)
- Four Roses Bourbon - $59.99
- Four Roses Bourbon Pairing - $60 (likely same product)
- Four Roses Single Barrel Bourbon Oesk - (unique: single barrel OESK recipe)

#### Maker's Mark (2 entries, likely 2 unique products)
- Maker's Mark Bourbon - $29.99 (54.4% ABV)
- Makers Mark Cask Strength - $39.965 (55% ABV, unique variant)

### 3. Price Variations for Same Products
- **Buffalo Trace**: $10 difference between listings ($119.99 vs $129.99)
- **Four Roses**: Nearly identical pricing ($59.99 vs $60)
- **Woodford Reserve**: Identical pricing for base product ($69.495)

### 4. Why Current Fuzzy Matching (0.7/0.6) Isn't Catching All Duplicates

#### Successfully Caught:
- Buffalo Trace Bourbon vs Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon (0.700 similarity)
- Woodford Reserve Bourbon vs Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon (0.727 similarity)

#### Missed Duplicates:
- Four Roses Bourbon vs Four Roses Single Barrel Bourbon Oesk (0.655 similarity - below threshold)
- Parsing issues like "Straight Bourbon Whiskey-woodford Reserve" not matching properly
- Minor variations like "Maker's" vs "Makers" affecting similarity scores

### 5. Data Quality Issues

1. **Inconsistent Naming**:
   - Some include "Kentucky Straight" designation, others don't
   - Hyphenation and punctuation variations
   - Word order variations

2. **Non-Product Entries**:
   - "Buffalo Trace's Single Estate Farm Continues Expansion" appears to be an article title
   - "Retail Bourbon-bhg" seems to be a category or placeholder

3. **Missing Data**:
   - Some entries lack prices
   - ABV data inconsistently populated

## Recommendations for Improved Deduplication

### 1. Enhanced Name Normalization
```javascript
// Current approach misses these patterns:
- Remove "Kentucky Straight" uniformly
- Standardize possessives (Maker's â†’ Makers)
- Handle word order variations
- Remove common suffixes like "Whiskey", "Bourbon"
```

### 2. Adjust Fuzzy Matching Thresholds
- Consider lowering nameThreshold to 0.65 for bourbon category
- Implement category-specific thresholds
- Add special handling for known brand variations

### 3. Implement Multi-Stage Matching
```javascript
// Stage 1: Brand extraction and matching
// Stage 2: Product variant identification
// Stage 3: Attribute comparison (ABV, proof, age)
```

### 4. Add Brand Dictionaries
Create mappings for known variations:
- "Maker's Mark" = "Makers Mark"
- "E H Taylor Jr" = "E.H. Taylor Jr."
- Include common abbreviations and alternate spellings

### 5. Improve Data Extraction
- Better parsing of compound names
- Separate brand from product line
- Extract and normalize variant descriptors (Cask Strength, Barrel Proof, etc.)

## Actual Duplicate Rate Calculation

**Conservative Estimate (confirmed duplicates)**:
- Buffalo Trace: 2 duplicates
- Woodford Reserve: 2 duplicates
- Four Roses: 1 duplicate
- Total: 5 duplicates out of 32 = **15.6%**

**Aggressive Estimate (including likely duplicates)**:
- Buffalo Trace: 2 duplicates + 1 questionable
- Woodford Reserve: 2 duplicates + 1 parsing issue
- Four Roses: 1 duplicate
- Other questionable entries: 2
- Total: 10 duplicates out of 32 = **31.3%**

**Best Estimate**: **20-25% duplicate rate** in the current dataset

## Conclusion

The current fuzzy matching system with thresholds of 0.7 (name) and 0.6 (combined) is catching approximately 40-50% of duplicates. The main issues are:

1. Name variations that fall just below the threshold
2. Lack of brand-aware matching logic
3. Inconsistent data extraction and normalization
4. No special handling for common bourbon naming patterns

Implementing the recommended improvements could increase duplicate detection accuracy to 90%+ while maintaining low false positive rates.
