# Catalog Scraper Issues & Fixes Tracking

## Document Purpose
This document tracks all issues, fixes, and improvements for the V2.5.6 catalog scraper to ensure continuous quality improvement.

## Critical Issues Found (2025-06-12)

### ðŸš¨ MAJOR QUALITY ISSUES

#### 1. **Non-Product Content Being Stored**
- **Issue**: Storing website names, article titles, and other non-product content
- **Examples**: 
  - "Glenfiddich Distillery-whisky.com" (website URL)
  - "The History Of Glenfiddich Whisky" (article title)
- **Root Cause**: `isValidProductName()` validation is too weak
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Needs immediate fix

#### 2. **Truncated Product Names**
- **Issue**: Product names being cut off with "..." 
- **Examples**: 
  - "Glenfiddich 12 Year Single Malt Scotch Whisky 1. Crown Wine ..."
  - "Glenfiddich 15 Yr Single Malt Scotch Whisky Same-day Delivery ..."
- **Root Cause**: Extracting from meta tags/titles that have character limits
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Needs immediate fix

#### 3. **Missing Critical Product Data**
- **Issue**: Many spirits missing essential data
- **Missing Fields**:
  - Price (only 1 out of 5 has price)
  - Volume (defaulting to 750ml without verification)
  - Proper brand extraction
  - Product descriptions are generic/promotional
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - Needs improvement

#### 4. **Poor Data Quality Scores**
- **Issue**: Quality scores (45-90) not reflecting actual poor quality
- **Problem**: Scoring algorithm giving points for bad data
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - Scoring needs overhaul

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues:
1. **Weak Product Name Validation**: The `V25CriticalFixes.isValidProductName()` is not filtering out non-product content effectively
2. **Poor Source Extraction**: Pulling from page titles/meta tags instead of structured product data
3. **No Post-Extraction Validation**: Not checking if extracted content is actually a product
4. **Truncation Not Handled**: Not detecting and handling truncated names

## Proposed Fixes

### Immediate Fixes Needed:

#### Fix 1: Enhanced Product Name Validation
```typescript
// Add to isValidProductName validation
const invalidPatterns = [
  /\.com$/i,              // Website domains
  /^the history of/i,     // Article titles
  /^how to/i,             // Guide titles
  /delivery$/i,           // Service descriptions
  /same-day/i,            // Delivery options
  /crown wine$/i,         // Store names at end
  /\.\.\.$/,              // Truncated content
];

// Must contain actual product identifiers
const mustContain = [
  /\d+\s*(year|yr|yo)/i,  // Age statements
  /single malt|bourbon|rye|vodka|gin|rum|tequila/i,  // Spirit types
  /\d+ml|liter|bottle/i,   // Volume indicators
];
```

#### Fix 2: Handle Truncated Names
- Detect truncation indicators ("...", "1.", cut-off text)
- Try to fetch full name from actual product page
- Mark as low quality if truncated

#### Fix 3: Improve Data Extraction
- Prioritize structured data over meta tags
- Look for JSON-LD product data
- Extract from actual product elements, not page titles

#### Fix 4: Post-Storage Validation
- After extraction, validate that we have a real product
- Check for minimum required fields
- Reject entries that are clearly not products

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. Update `V25CriticalFixes.isValidProductName()` with stricter validation
2. Add truncation detection and handling
3. Implement post-extraction validation

### Phase 2: Data Quality Improvements (Next Sprint)
1. Improve structured data extraction
2. Add product page scraping for truncated names
3. Enhance quality scoring algorithm

### Phase 3: Long-term Improvements
1. Machine learning for product detection
2. Image analysis for product verification
3. Price extraction from multiple sources

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] No website URLs stored as products
- [ ] No article titles stored as products
- [ ] No truncated names in database
- [ ] All products have at least name, type, and source
- [ ] Quality scores accurately reflect data completeness

## Success Metrics
- 0% non-product entries
- <5% truncated names
- >80% products with price data
- >90% products with accurate type classification
- Average quality score >75 for new entries

## Version History
- **2025-06-12**: Initial document created after discovering critical quality issues
- **Issue Reporter**: User identified horrible results in spirits_rows (29).csv

## Fix Implementation Results (2025-06-12)

### âœ… Successfully Fixed:
1. **Website/domain rejection**: "Glenfiddich Distillery - Whisky.com" correctly rejected
2. **Article rejection**: "The history of Glenfiddich whisky" correctly rejected  
3. **Truncated name rejection**: Names ending with "..." are being rejected
4. **Delivery text rejection**: "Same-Day Delivery ..." correctly rejected
5. **Store names rejection**: "Buy Glenfiddich Whisky Online" correctly rejected

### ðŸŸ¡ Partial Success:
1. **Name cleaning**: Truncated names are cleaned but some still have artifacts
2. **Quality improvement**: From 5 horrible entries to 3 acceptable entries (60% stored)

### ðŸ”´ New Issues Found:
1. **Over-rejection of valid products**:
   - "Glenfiddich Grand Cru" rejected (missing whisky/whiskey keyword)
   - "Glenfiddich Grande Couronne" rejected
   - Valid products without explicit spirit keywords being rejected

2. **Poor quality names still stored**:
   - "Glenfiddich Experimental Series-orchard (43%) Bottega Whiskey"
   - Names with store artifacts "(43%)" and "Bottega Whiskey"

3. **Price extraction issues**:
   - Price $2900 extracted (likely wrong currency or decimal place)
   - Price $20 extracted (suspiciously low for premium whisky)

## Next Steps:
1. Refine validation to accept products without explicit keywords if from known distilleries âœ… DONE
2. Add post-processing to clean store artifacts from names âœ… DONE (but needs integration fix)
3. Improve price validation (reasonable range: $30-$5000)
4. Add currency conversion for non-USD prices

## Test Results After Fixes (2025-06-12)

### âœ… Major Improvements:
1. **Rejected bad entries**: 
   - "Glenfiddich Distillery - Whisky.com" âœ… REJECTED
   - "The history of Glenfiddich whisky" âœ… REJECTED
   - "Buy Glenfiddich Whisky Online" âœ… REJECTED
   - All truncated names with "..." âœ… REJECTED

2. **Better validation**:
   - Now accepts "Glenfiddich Grand Cru" (known distillery)
   - Accepts special editions without explicit whisky keyword

3. **Store artifacts cleaning** (implemented but needs integration):
   - Successfully cleans "(43%)" formatting
   - Removes "Bottega Whiskey" store names
   - Fixes "Series-orchard" to "Series Orchard"

### ðŸ”´ Remaining Issues:
1. ~~**Store artifact cleaning not being applied during storage**~~ âœ… FIXED - The cleaning was integrated but had capitalization issues with apostrophes. Now properly cleans store artifacts while preserving proper names.
2. **Price issues**: $2900 (wrong currency?) and $20 (too low) - Price validation implemented but needs testing
3. **Old bad data still in database** from before fixes - Need to run cleanup script

## Summary:
- Validation is now MUCH better - rejecting most garbage
- From 5 terrible entries to 2-3 acceptable entries per batch
- Store artifact cleaning âœ… FIXED and working correctly
- Price validation âœ… IMPLEMENTED ($10-$5000 range with auto-adjustment)
- Need to clean up existing bad data in database (cleanup script encounters Supabase config issues)

## Fixed Issues (2025-06-12 Latest):
1. âœ… Store artifact cleaning now properly integrated
   - Fixed apostrophe capitalization issue (Maker's Mark)
   - Fixed Series-orchard â†’ Series Orchard
   - Removes (43%), Bottega Whiskey, Crown Wine, etc.
   - Tested and working in applyAllFixes()

2. âœ… Price validation implemented
   - Rejects prices < $10 or > $5000
   - Auto-adjusts suspicious prices (Ã—10 if too low, Ã·100 if too high)
   - Extracts prices from descriptions if missing
   
3. âœ… Product name validation greatly improved
   - Rejects websites, articles, truncated names
   - Requires spirit indicators OR known distillery names
   - Prevents storage of non-product content

## Still To Do:
1. Fix Supabase configuration for cleanup script
2. Add currency conversion for non-USD prices
3. Improve price extraction patterns
